                <h2>About us</h2>
                    <p>As a team, we have consistently heard "I don't have time to get shredded!" or "Going to the gym isn't exciting enough for me!" - we have been working hard to create a product that not only gets you shredded, but is tons of fun to do!</p>

                <h2>What You Might Have Heard</h2>
                    <p>Many fitness experts will tell you that strength gains are only found in full range-of-motion exercises. This has become the basis for many negative Shake Weight reviews. However, the Shake Weight for Men and the Shake Weight for Women are not products designed or advertised for strength gains. The Shake Weight is designed to burn calories, increase tone, and create muscle definition by reducing body fat in muscle areas. At these tasks, it does incredibly well.</p>
